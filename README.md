Pure Redux

Only contains Redux without any HTML, CSS or any other crappy thing :wink:

Implement same examples to learn Redux easily. Trust me I did it & I :heart_eyes: it. Now you can too.

Examples provided below are in order of difficulty.

The top ones are the easiest with difficulty level increasing going below.

### [1] [Increment Decrement](increment-decrement.js)

### [2] [Counter](counter.js)

### [3] [Todo](todo.js)
